<h1>CipherApp</h1>

<h3>Project Description</h3>
The CipherApp is a utility app and also an educational tool, it encrypts and decrypts alphabetical text using either Caesar Cipher or Vigenere Cipher method.
<ul>
<li><b>The CipherApp was built using C# and Windows Forms(.NET Framework)</li>
  <br>
<li>If Caeser Cipher is selected, the user is able to enter any key shift value from 1 to 25 to encrypt or decrypt text.</li>
<li>If Vigenere Cipher is selected, the user is able to enter alphebetical text as their key to encrypt or decrypt text.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Planned features and goals to be added to the project</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Adding other encryption methods</li>
  <li>Allowing for encryption of files</li>
  <li>Securing the app with user authentication</li>
  <li>Content explaining how this encryption methods work</li>
  <br>
  <li>Potentially convert to an ASP.NET</li>
</ul>
